[How Graphics Cards Work](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/graphics-card.htm)
- Creating an image out of binary data is a demanding process. To make a 3-D image, the graphics card first creates a wire frame out of straight lines. Then, it rasterizes the image (fills in the remaining pixels). It also adds lighting, texture and color. For fast-paced games, the computer has to go through this process about 60 to 120 times per second. Without a graphics card to perform the necessary calculations, the workload would be too much for the computer to handle.

[Why are CPUs still being made when GPUs are so much faster?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-CPUs-still-being-made-when-GPUs-are-so-much-faster/answer/Boris-Petrov-7)
This is GPU:

Can work with tons of data, but cannot do much else.

And this is CPU:

Cannot carry much of the cargo, but extremely fast and flexible.

Each one is good for its own tasks, but not efficient for others.

Jet can bring one small block of cargo fast enough, but it takes weeks to carry thousands.

Ship can bring thousands of blocks in one call, but cannot perform any complicated and fast work.
