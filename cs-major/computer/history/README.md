## [How did vacuum tubes allow the first computers to perform digital computations?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-vacuum-tubes-allow-the-first-computers-to-perform-digital-computations)

Before vacuum tubes, you could do Boolean logic with relays and make flip-flops to store data. However relays were slow, switching only tens of times per second and did not last too long. The mechanical contacts got dirty or pitted. But still they were better than the purely mechanical computing devices that preceded them.

Vacuum tubes could act as **diodes** to build diode logic circuits. The **triode** added a control element, the grid, which allowed the tube to be used as a switch with two states, saturated (passing maximal current) and blocked (passing no current). And two triodes with positive feedback made a flip-flop storing one bit of data. They could switch thousands of times per second and were longer-lived and more reliable. As tube technology improved from the 1920’s to the 1950’s the tubes became much smaller, consumed less power, and were much faster.
