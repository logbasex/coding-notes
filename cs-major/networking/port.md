> When some random data (packet) comes on your cell phone.. How do you think your cellphone knows whether that packet needs to be sent to your Facebook app, your Google+ app or your browser?

- Every such app will have a number associated with them, those are called "port numbers". So when some data comes we look at the data (packet), it'll contain the port number and your cellphone goes to the app and says: "Take this, this belongs to you"
