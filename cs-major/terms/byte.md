## Bit (**Bi**nary Digi**t**)
> 8 bits were historically used to encode a single character of text in computer and hence became one byte or the smallest adressable memory.

> The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte has been the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer. Early character encoding systems often used 6-bits and machines using either 6-bit or 9-bit characters were common into the 1960s.

### [Why do bytes exist? Why don't we just use bits?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32491925/why-do-bytes-exist-why-dont-we-just-use-bits)
> Because at the hardware level memory is naturally organized into addressable chunks. Small chunks means that you can have fine grained things like 4 bit numbers; large chunks allow for more efficient operation (typically a CPU moves things around in 'chunks' or multiple thereof). IN particular larger addressable chunks make for bigger address spaces. If I have chunks that are 1 bit then an address range of 1 - 500 only covers 500 bits whereas 500 8 bit chunks cover 4000 bits.
