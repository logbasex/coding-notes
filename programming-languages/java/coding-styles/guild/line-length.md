## What is optimal line length for code today

**While there's no universally agreed-upon optimal line length for code, a common recommendation is to aim for around 80-120 characters, balancing readability, maintainability, and compatibility considerations.**

**Here's a breakdown of key factors to consider:**

- **Readability:**
    - Shorter lines are generally easier to scan and comprehend, especially when viewing code side-by-side or on smaller screens.
    - Excessively long lines can strain the eyes and make it harder to track the flow of logic.

- **Maintainability:**
    - Shorter lines often make it easier to edit and compare code during version control and collaboration.
    - Longer lines can become more challenging to manage as code evolves.

- **Compatibility:**
    - 80 characters is a historical standard from punch card days, still relevant for:
        - Terminal windows that might wrap lines awkwardly.
        - Code review tools that might truncate longer lines.
        - Some style guides that enforce stricter limits.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Language and Context:**
    - Some languages, like Python, have strong conventions around line length (often 79 characters).
    - Certain contexts, like code examples in documentation, might benefit from even shorter lines for clarity.

- **Personal Preferences and Team Guidelines:**
    - Individual developers often have their own preferences within reasonable ranges.
    - Teams often establish specific line length guidelines in their style guides to ensure consistency.

**Best Practices:**

- **Prioritize readability:** Focus on making code easy to understand, even if it means slightly longer lines in some cases.
- **Be mindful of compatibility:** Consider the tools and environments where your code will be used.
- **Follow style guides:** Adhere to existing guidelines for consistency and collaboration.
- **Use tools for enforcement:** Many code editors and linters can automatically highlight or warn about lines exceeding a specified length.
- **Break lines sensibly:** Avoid arbitrary line breaks that disrupt code structure or logic.
- **Use indentation wisely:** Proper indentation can enhance readability even with longer lines.
- **Consider wrapping techniques:** For long expressions or URLs, consider techniques like parentheses or backslashes to break lines without affecting code execution.

**Experiment and find what works best for you and your team, balancing these factors to achieve readable, maintainable, and compatible code.**
