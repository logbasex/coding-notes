## Arrow up (↑) and Arrow down (↓) symbols appear next to a branch name in Git.

Ah, I see. When both the arrow up (`↑`) and arrow down (`↓`) symbols appear next to a branch name in Git, it indicates a situation where your local branch has diverged from the remote tracking branch. This means that there are changes in both your local branch and the remote branch that are not present in the other. Here’s what each symbol signifies in this context:

- **Arrow Up (`↑`)**: Your local branch has commits that are not in the remote branch. This is typically after you've made local commits that have not yet been pushed.

- **Arrow Down (`↓`)**: The remote branch has commits that are not in your local branch. This usually happens when others have pushed commits to the remote branch which you have not yet pulled.

For example, if you see `↑2 ↓3` next to your branch name, it means that you have two commits in your local branch that are not in the remote branch, and there are three commits in the remote branch that you do not have locally.

This situation is common after a rebase, especially if both you and others are committing to the same branch. After rebasing locally, your commits might have new commit hashes (even if the changes are the same), making them different from those in the remote branch. At the same time, if there were new commits pushed to the remote branch that you haven't pulled, they will contribute to the divergence.

To resolve this, you typically have a few options:

1. **Push your changes**: If you're certain that your changes should be integrated and there are no conflicts with the remote changes, you can force push. However, this should be done with caution, as it can overwrite changes in the remote branch.

2. **Pull remote changes first**: You can fetch and merge (or rebase) the remote changes into your local branch. This can help to integrate the remote changes with your own before pushing.

3. **Pull and merge**: A safer approach when working collaboratively is to pull the remote changes and merge them with your local changes. This preserves both sets of changes and allows for conflict resolution if needed.

In collaborative environments, it's crucial to communicate with your team when handling such divergences, especially if force pushing is considered, to avoid disrupting others' work.

## It happens when I rebase my own branch onto master

When you rebase your own branch onto the master branch and then see both the arrow up (`↑`) and arrow down (`↓`) symbols next to your branch name in Git, this indicates that your local branch has diverged from the remote version of your branch. This situation can arise from the rebase operation. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **Before the Rebase**: Initially, your branch and the remote version of your branch are in sync.

2. **Rebasing onto Master**: When you rebase your branch onto the master branch, you're essentially moving your branch's commits so that they appear to be based on the latest commit of the master branch. This is a common practice to integrate the latest changes from the master branch into your feature branch while keeping a clean history.

3. **After the Rebase**: Rebasing rewrites the commit history of your branch. Each of your commits is re-applied on top of the master branch, resulting in new commit hashes. Even if the changes in the commits remain the same, the fact that their hashes have changed means Git sees them as entirely new commits.

4. **Divergence Indicated by Arrows**:
    - **Arrow Up (`↑`)**: This shows that your local branch now has new commits (the rebased commits) that are not in the remote branch.
    - **Arrow Down (`↓`)**: This indicates that the remote branch has the old versions of your commits (pre-rebase) that your local branch no longer has because of the rebase.

5. **Resolving the Divergence**: To resolve this, you typically need to force push (`git push --force`) your local rebased branch to the remote. This will overwrite the remote branch with your newly rebased commits. However, force pushing should be done with caution, especially if others might be working on the same branch, as it can overwrite changes in the remote branch. In your case, since it's your own branch and you've just rebased onto master, it's likely safe to do so.

6. **Communicate and Coordinate**: If you're working in a team, it's essential to communicate with your team members about rebasing and force pushing, particularly if they might be affected or have branches that are based on the same branch you're rebasing.

In summary, after rebasing your branch onto master, the `↑` and `↓` symbols indicate that your local branch and the remote branch have diverged due to the new commit hashes created by the rebase. The usual way to synchronize them is by force pushing your local branch to the remote repository.

## Why it happens: This indicates that the remote branch has the old versions of your commits (pre-rebase) that your local branch no longer has because of the rebase.

The situation you're describing occurs because of how Git tracks the history of commits and how rebasing alters this history. Let's delve into why this happens:

1. **Original Commit History**: Initially, both your local branch and its remote counterpart share the same commit history. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash), which Git uses to track changes.

2. **Rebasing Your Branch**: When you rebase your branch onto the master branch, you're changing the base of your branch's commit history to the latest commit on the master branch. This operation effectively rewrites the history of your branch.

3. **Effect of Rebasing on Commit Hashes**: During rebasing, Git applies the changes from your original commits onto the new base. This process creates new commits with different hashes, even if the content of the changes remains the same. Git sees these new commits as different from the original ones because commit hashes are not just based on the content of the changes, but also on other factors like timestamps and parent commit hashes.

4. **Local vs. Remote Branch After Rebasing**: After the rebase, your local branch has a new set of commit hashes (the rebased commits), while the remote branch still has the old commit hashes (pre-rebase). To Git, this means the branches have diverged:
    - The remote branch contains the old commits (which your local branch no longer has because of the rebase).
    - Your local branch contains the new, rebased commits (which the remote branch does not have).

5. **The `↑` and `↓` Symbols**: The arrow up (`↑`) symbol indicates that your local branch has new commits that are not in the remote branch (the rebased commits). The arrow down (`↓`) symbol indicates that the remote branch has commits that are no longer in your local branch (the original pre-rebase commits). This divergence is shown by Git to reflect that the two branches have different histories now.

6. **Resolving the Divergence**: To resolve this, you typically force push your local branch to the remote repository. This replaces the remote branch's history with your newly rebased commits. Doing so aligns the histories of both branches, but it's essential to be cautious with force pushing as it can overwrite changes on the remote branch.

In summary, this divergence happens because rebasing changes the commit hashes of your branch, making them different from the hashes in the remote branch, even if the content of the commits is effectively the same. This is a normal part of the rebasing process in Git and is resolved by force pushing the rebased branch to the remote repository.
