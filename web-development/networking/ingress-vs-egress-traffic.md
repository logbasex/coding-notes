## Ingress traffic vs Egress traffic
In the context of REST APIs, "ingress" and "egress" refer to the flow of data into and out of the API server, respectively. These terms are often used in the context of network traffic and data management.

1. **Ingress in REST API:**
    - **Definition:** Ingress refers to incoming traffic to the API server. This is the data sent to the API server by the clients.
    - **Examples:**
        - API requests sent by clients (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests).
        - Data payload in POST or PUT requests.
        - Authentication tokens or headers sent along with the requests.

2. **Egress in REST API:**
    - **Definition:** Egress refers to outgoing traffic from the API server. This is the data the API server sends back to the clients.
    - **Examples:**
        - API responses sent back to clients, including status codes and data.
        - Data retrieved from a database or another service that is then formatted and sent back to the client.
        - Headers or tokens that are part of the response.

Understanding and managing ingress and egress is crucial for API performance, security, and cost management, especially in cloud-based environments where data transfer costs can be significant. For instance, a well-designed API should efficiently handle ingress requests to avoid overloading the server and should optimize egress responses to minimize bandwidth usage and ensure quick response times.

Ingress and egress also have implications for security, as they are points at which data can be intercepted or manipulated. Therefore, securing both ingress and egress traffic is essential to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the API.
