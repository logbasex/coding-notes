## Block Nested Loop Join (BNL)

Block Nested Loop Join (BNL) is a variant of the nested loop join algorithm in MySQL. It aims to improve performance by reducing the number of disk I/O operations, particularly useful when dealing with large tables where traditional nested loop joins may incur significant overhead. Let's explore BNL in more detail:

**Basic Concept**:
>-  BNL operates similarly to the basic nested loop join but processes blocks of rows from the inner table at a time, instead of individual rows.
>
> 
> - **The outer table is still scanned row by row, but for each iteration of the outer loop, a block of rows from the inner table is fetched into memory and processed.**

**Step-by-Step Process**:
1. For each row in the outer table:
    - Access the row.
    - Read a block of rows from the inner table into memory.
    - For each row in the block:
        - Check if the join condition is satisfied.
        - If satisfied, output the combined row.

**Cost Estimation**:
- The cost of BNL involves disk I/O operations for fetching blocks of rows from the inner table into memory.
- The total cost depends on factors such as the size of the tables, block size, disk I/O performance, and the selectivity of the join condition.
- If the inner table is significantly larger than available memory, BNL can reduce disk I/O overhead compared to traditional nested loop joins.

**Performance Considerations**:
- BNL is particularly effective when the inner table is much larger than the available memory.
- It can also benefit from sequential access to the inner table, as fetching blocks of rows at a time reduces disk seek time.
- However, BNL may still suffer from performance issues if the inner table is too large to fit entirely in memory or if the join condition requires random access to the inner table.

**Use Cases**:
- Suitable for joining large tables where other join algorithms, such as hash join or sort merge join, might be less efficient due to memory constraints or sorting overhead.
- Effective when the join condition benefits from sequential access to the inner table and when disk I/O performance is a bottleneck.

In summary, Block Nested Loop Join is a valuable optimization technique in MySQL for reducing disk I/O overhead when joining large tables. It leverages block-wise processing of the inner table to improve performance compared to traditional nested loop joins, especially in scenarios with limited memory or high disk I/O latency.

## when we need Basic Nested Loop Join while have Block Nested Loop Join?

Certainly, let's delve deeper into scenarios where Basic Nested Loop Join (NLJ) may be preferred over Block Nested Loop Join (BNL), despite the availability of both join algorithms:

1. **Small Tables**:
    - **Scenario**: When dealing with relatively small tables where both the outer and inner tables can easily fit into memory.
    - **Reasoning**: In such cases, the overhead of fetching blocks of rows from the inner table using BNL may outweigh any potential performance gains. NLJ can efficiently process the join without the need for block-wise processing.

2. **Memory Constraints**:
    - **Scenario**: Limited memory resources prevent efficient caching of even blocks of rows from the inner table.
    - **Reasoning**: BNL relies on caching blocks of rows into memory, and if memory is severely limited, NLJ may be preferred as it requires less memory overhead. NLJ can process the join row by row without relying on significant memory resources.

3. **Random Access Patterns**:
    - **Scenario**: Join conditions involve non-sequential access patterns or irregular data access.
    - **Reasoning**: BNL's block-wise processing is most beneficial when the join condition benefits from sequential access to the inner table. If the join condition involves random access patterns, NLJ may be more suitable as it can efficiently handle such scenarios without the need for block-wise processing.

4. **Cost-Based Optimizer Decision**:
    - **Scenario**: The query optimizer determines that NLJ is more efficient based on cost estimates and statistics, even when BNL is available.
    - **Reasoning**: The optimizer considers various factors such as table sizes, selectivity of join conditions, and available system resources to determine the most efficient join strategy. In some cases, NLJ may be chosen over BNL for its simplicity and stability in query plans.

5. **Query Plan Stability**:
    - **Scenario**: Using NLJ results in more stable query plans that are less sensitive to changes in data distribution or system configuration.
    - **Reasoning**: BNL may introduce additional complexity and variability in query plans, especially when dealing with dynamic workloads or fluctuating data sizes. NLJ's simplicity may lead to more predictable query execution behavior in such scenarios.

6. **Join Condition Characteristics**:
    - **Scenario**: Join conditions involve complex predicates or non-standard comparisons that are not well-suited for block-wise processing.
    - **Reasoning**: BNL is most effective when the join condition benefits from sequential access to the inner table and when there is a significant reduction in disk I/O overhead. If the join condition involves complex predicates or non-standard comparisons, NLJ may be preferred for its straightforward row-by-row processing approach.

In summary, while Block Nested Loop Join offers advantages in certain scenarios such as large tables and sequential access patterns, there are situations where Basic Nested Loop Join may be preferred due to factors such as small table sizes, memory constraints, random access patterns, optimizer decisions, query plan stability, and join condition characteristics. The choice between NLJ and BNL depends on various factors, and the query optimizer makes decisions based on cost estimates and statistical information to determine the most efficient join strategy for a given query.
