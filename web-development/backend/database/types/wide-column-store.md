## NoSQL Database and its Types
- Key-value store
- Document store
- Wide column store
- Graph database

## Column Family

> The concept of a **column family** in Cassandra (or other wide column stores) is somewhat analogous to a "document" in MongoDB (or other document stores) and a "table" in traditional relational databases, but there are important differences in how they are structured and used.

Figure 2: Logical view of a wide column database. The key point to observe here is that the database is schemaless, and each row need not contain all columns. All names, addresses, phone numbers are illustrative/not real.
