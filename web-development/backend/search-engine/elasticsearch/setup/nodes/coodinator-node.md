## What if elasticsearch cluster is missing dedicated coordinator node? Show detail example

Let's dive into a more detailed example by breaking down how Elasticsearch handles requests with and without dedicated coordinator nodes. This example will illustrate the operational differences in a scenario involving client search requests in a small to medium-sized Elasticsearch cluster.

### Scenario Without Dedicated Coordinator Nodes

Imagine you have an Elasticsearch cluster with 5 data nodes (Node A to Node E) but no dedicated coordinator nodes. All nodes hold data and are also responsible for handling search requests from clients.

#### Client Request Flow:

1. **Client Request Initiation**: A client sends a search request to the cluster. The request can land on any node since all nodes accept client requests. Assume it lands on Node A.
2. **Search Phase 1 - Scatter**: Node A becomes the coordinating node for this request. It parses the request and forwards it to all relevant shards across the cluster. This means it might send sub-requests to Node B, Node C, Node D, and Node E, as well as to itself if it holds relevant shards.
3. **Search Phase 2 - Gather**: Each node processes the search on its local shards and sends the results back to Node A. Node A then has to compile these results, sort them, and potentially apply aggregations.
4. **Response to Client**: Node A sends the final response back to the client.

#### Challenges:

- **Increased Load**: Node A is handling additional work on top of its data node responsibilities. This extra load increases CPU and memory usage, potentially affecting its performance on data tasks.
- **Uneven Load Distribution**: If multiple clients send requests that end up being coordinated by the same node (e.g., Node A), that node could become a bottleneck.
- **Resource Contention**: Nodes juggle between coordinating search requests and managing their data, leading to resource contention, which can degrade search performance and response times.

### Scenario With Dedicated Coordinator Nodes

Now, let's add 2 dedicated coordinator nodes (Coordinator 1 and Coordinator 2) to the same cluster. These nodes will not hold data but will instead focus on managing and distributing client requests.

#### Client Request Flow with Coordinator Nodes:

1. **Client Request Initiation**: A client sends a search request to the cluster, but this time it is directed to one of the dedicated coordinator nodes, say Coordinator 1.
2. **Search Phase 1 - Scatter**: Coordinator 1 takes on the role of coordinating the request. It understands the cluster's state and distributes the search request to nodes A through E, targeting all relevant shards.
3. **Search Phase 2 - Gather**: Nodes A through E process the request on their local shards and return the results to Coordinator 1, which doesn't have the overhead of managing data, allowing it to efficiently aggregate results.
4. **Response to Client**: Coordinator 1 sends the compiled and sorted results back to the client.

#### Benefits:

- **Focused Resource Utilization**: Data nodes (A to E) can focus on their primary tasks without the added load of coordinating client requests, improving data handling efficiency.
- **Improved Load Balancing**: Coordinator nodes can distribute client requests more evenly across the data nodes, preventing any single node from becoming a bottleneck.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Dedicated coordinator nodes are optimized for request coordination, leading to faster aggregation and sorting of results, which improves overall search performance and response times.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: It's easier to scale the cluster by adding more coordinator nodes as the query load increases, without affecting the data nodes' capacity to manage and store data.

### Conclusion for Newbies

Incorporating dedicated coordinator nodes into an Elasticsearch cluster setup significantly improves the efficiency and performance of handling client requests. Data nodes are relieved from the extra coordination work, allowing them to better perform their primary tasks of storing, indexing, and searching data. Meanwhile, coordinator nodes provide a specialized role that optimizes request distribution and result aggregation, leading to better load balancing, enhanced performance, and increased scalability of the cluster. This architecture adjustment is particularly beneficial in larger, more demanding environments but can also offer performance improvements in smaller setups.

## How node identify the relevant shard? maybe matching data will be on the all shards?
When an Elasticsearch node receives a search request and needs to identify the relevant shards to query, it uses several mechanisms to determine which shards might contain the data matching the search criteria. The ability to identify relevant shards efficiently is crucial for optimizing the search process and ensuring quick response times. Here's how this determination process works:

### Index and Shard Routing

- **Index Metadata**: Each index in Elasticsearch is divided into shards, which are distributed across the cluster's nodes. An index's metadata, which is known to all nodes in the cluster, includes information about which shards make up the index and where those shards are located (i.e., on which nodes).
- **Routing Value**: When documents are indexed in Elasticsearch, a routing value (by default, the document ID) is used to determine which shard a given document will be stored in. This process ensures that documents are evenly distributed across shards.

### Determining Relevant Shards for a Search Request

1. **Index Targeting**: A search request typically specifies one or more indices to search within. The coordinating node uses this information to narrow down the list of potentially relevant shards to those that belong to the specified indices.

2. **Shard Routing**: For certain types of queries (e.g., those that include an exact value for a document ID or a routing key), the coordinating node can use the same routing mechanism that's used during indexing to target specific shards. This is because the routing value that determines where a document is stored can also be used to locate it during a search.

3. **Broadcasting to All Shards**: If the search request does not specify a routing key or if the query is broad (e.g., a match query on a common field), the coordinating node cannot a priori determine which shards contain the relevant data. In such cases, it broadcasts the search request to all shards within the targeted indices. Each shard then searches through its documents to find matches.

### Handling Broad Queries

- **Broad Query Handling**: For queries that potentially match documents across many or all shards of an index, Elasticsearch employs a two-phase retrieval process (query-then-fetch) to efficiently handle the search:
    - **Query Phase**: Each involved shard executes the query against its documents to identify the top documents that match the query criteria, based on the specified sort and scoring criteria. Only a limited number of top-matching document IDs and their scores are returned to the coordinating node.
    - **Fetch Phase**: Once the coordinating node receives the top document IDs from each shard, it identifies the global top documents and issues a fetch request to retrieve the full document data from the respective shards.

### Optimizations and Efficiency

Elasticsearch's distributed nature allows for parallel processing of queries across shards, significantly speeding up search operations, especially for large datasets. The cluster state, which includes metadata about indices, shards, and their locations, enables nodes to efficiently route queries and aggregate results. Additionally, features like shard replicas provide both high availability and load balancing, as search queries can be routed to less busy replicas to optimize resource usage.

In summary, while Elasticsearch may broadcast queries to all shards of targeted indices for broad searches, it uses index metadata, routing values, and query optimizations to efficiently identify and query relevant shards, ensuring fast and accurate search results.

## Show me example illustrate the role of coordinator node with example

To illustrate the role of coordinator nodes in Elasticsearch or OpenSearch clusters with an example, let's consider a scenario involving a large e-commerce platform. This platform uses an Elasticsearch cluster to manage and search through its extensive product catalog, which includes millions of items across thousands of categories. The platform receives complex queries from users who are looking for products based on various criteria like price, ratings, availability, and specific attributes like color, size, or brand.

### Scenario: Complex Product Search

Imagine a user searching for "waterproof smartwatches under $200 with at least a 4-star rating, available in black or blue." This query is complex because it involves:
- Filtering based on price, rating, and availability.
- Aggregating products by attributes like color.
- Sorting results by relevance and price.

### Without Coordinator Nodes

Without dedicated coordinator nodes, each data node would receive the query directly. The nodes would then have to work on both executing the query against their local data and coordinating the overall query execution, including result aggregation and sorting. This dual role could lead to several issues:
- **Increased Load on Data Nodes**: Data nodes would have to manage both data storage/retrieval tasks and the computational overhead of coordinating responses, which could slow down query execution.
- **Inefficient Query Routing**: Without a global view of the cluster's data distribution, queries might be sent to all nodes, even if only a subset holds relevant data, leading to unnecessary processing.
- **Uneven Workload Distribution**: Some nodes might become overloaded with coordination tasks, especially if they're hit with several complex queries simultaneously, leading to bottlenecks.

### With Coordinator Nodes

When coordinator nodes are deployed, they take over the task of query coordination and result aggregation. Here's how the process unfolds:
1. **Query Routing**: The coordinator node receives the user's query and determines which data nodes contain the relevant shards. It then routes the query only to those nodes, reducing unnecessary workload and network traffic.
2. **Parallel Processing**: Each data node executes the query against its local data and returns the preliminary results to the coordinator node. This parallel processing ensures efficient use of the cluster's computing resources.
3. **Result Aggregation**: The coordinator node receives results from all relevant data nodes. It then combines these results, applying the necessary filters, sorting, and aggregations to produce the final response. This step might involve complex operations like merging sorted lists and combining aggregations from different nodes.
4. **Load Balancing**: Coordinator nodes can distribute incoming queries among themselves to ensure no single node becomes a bottleneck. They manage the overall query load, ensuring a balanced distribution across the cluster.

### Outcome

By offloading the coordination and aggregation tasks to dedicated coordinator nodes, the e-commerce platform can ensure that data nodes are focused on efficiently handling data storage and retrieval. This separation of concerns leads to:
- **Faster Query Response Times**: Queries are executed more efficiently, leading to quicker response times for users.
- **Scalability**: The cluster can handle more complex queries and a higher volume of requests without performance degradation.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Computing resources are used more effectively, with data nodes focusing on their strengths and coordinator nodes managing the orchestration of queries and results.

In this example, coordinator nodes significantly enhance the cluster's ability to handle complex, resource-intensive queries by optimizing the use of resources, ensuring fast and accurate search results, and maintaining a responsive and scalable system.
