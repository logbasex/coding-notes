## Does elasticsearch is circuit-breaker system

Yes, Elasticsearch does have a circuit breaker system. Circuit breakers in Elasticsearch are designed to prevent operations from causing the node to run out of memory. These circuit breakers estimate the size of data structures used in operations and block operations if they threaten to use more memory than is available, thereby protecting the system from OutOfMemory errors.

There are several types of circuit breakers in Elasticsearch:

1. **Parent Circuit Breaker**: It's the main circuit breaker that monitors the overall memory used by the node. It checks against a percentage of the JVM heap memory allocated to Elasticsearch.

2. **Field Data Circuit Breaker**: This breaker estimates the size of field data loading into memory and prevents loading more field data if it would exceed a certain percentage of the JVM heap.

3. **Request Circuit Breaker**: It monitors the memory used by individual user requests and breaks if the request size goes over a certain limit.

4. **In-Flight Requests Circuit Breaker**: It limits the memory used by incoming network requests.

5. **Script Compilation Circuit Breaker**: This breaker limits the compilation of scripts to prevent memory abuse.

These circuit breakers help to maintain the stability and performance of an Elasticsearch cluster by preventing operations that could consume excessive amounts of memory. They are configurable, allowing administrators to adjust their settings based on the specific needs and capacities of their systems.
